**Develop software autonomously.**

RA.Aid (pronounced "raid") helps you develop software autonomously. It is a standalone coding agent built on LangGraph's agent-based task execution framework. The tool provides an intelligent assistant that can help with research, planning, and implementation of multi-step development tasks. RA.Aid can optionally integrate with `aider` (https://aider.chat/) via the `--use-aider` flag to leverage its specialized code editing capabilities.

The result is **near-fully-autonomous software development**.

### Prerequisites

Before using RA.Aid, you'll need API keys for the required AI services:

```bash
# Set up API keys based on your preferred provider:

# For Anthropic Claude models (recommended)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For OpenAI models (optional)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For OpenRouter provider (optional)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For OpenAI-compatible providers (optional)
export OPENAI_API_BASE=your_api_base_url

# For Gemini provider (optional)
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For web research capabilities
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Note: When using the `--use-aider` flag, the programmer tool (aider) will automatically select its model based on your available API keys:
- If ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set, it will use Claude models
- If only OPENAI_API_KEY is set, it will use OpenAI models
- You can set multiple API keys to enable different features

You can get your API keys from:
- Anthropic API key: https://console.anthropic.com/
- OpenAI API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- OpenRouter API key: https://openrouter.ai/keys
- Gemini API key: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

Note: `aider` must be installed separately as it is not included in the RA.Aid package. See [aider-chat](https://pypi.org/project/aider-chat/) for more details.

Complete installation documentation is available in our [Installation Guide](https://docs.ra-aid.ai/quickstart/installation).

### Human-in-the-Loop Mode

Enable interactive mode to allow the agent to ask you questions during task execution:

```bash
ra-aid -m "Implement a new feature" --hil
# or
ra-aid -m "Implement a new feature" -H
```

This mode is particularly useful for:
- Complex tasks requiring human judgment
- Clarifying ambiguous requirements
- Making architectural decisions
- Validating critical changes
- Providing domain-specific knowledge

### Web Research

<img src="assets/demo-web-research-1.gif" alt="RA.Aid Demo" autoplay loop style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">

The agent features autonomous web research capabilities powered by the [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) API, seamlessly integrating real-world information into its problem-solving workflow. Web research is conducted automatically when the agent determines additional context would be valuable - no explicit configuration required.

For example, when researching modern authentication practices or investigating new API requirements, the agent will autonomously:
- Search for current best practices and security recommendations
- Find relevant documentation and technical specifications
- Gather real-world implementation examples
- Stay updated on latest industry standards

While web research happens automatically as needed, you can also explicitly request research-focused tasks:

```bash
# Focused research task with web search capabilities
ra-aid -m "Research current best practices for API rate limiting" --research-only
```

Make sure to set your TAVILY_API_KEY environment variable to enable this feature.

### Chat Mode
<img src="assets/demo-chat-mode-1.gif" alt="Chat Mode Demo" autoplay loop style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">

Enable with `--chat` to transform ra-aid into an interactive assistant that guides you through research and implementation tasks. Have a natural conversation about what you want to build, explore options together, and dispatch work - all while maintaining context of your discussion. Perfect for when you want to think through problems collaboratively rather than just executing commands.

### Server with Web Interface

RA.Aid includes a modern server with web interface that provides:

- Beautiful dark-themed chat interface
- Real-time streaming of agent trajectory
- Responsive design that works on all devices

To launch the server with web interface:

```bash
# Start with default settings (0.0.0.0:1818)
ra-aid --server

# Specify custom host and port
ra-aid --server --server-host 127.0.0.1 --server-port 3000
```

Command line options for server with web interface:
- `--server`: Launch the server with web interface
- `--server-host`: Host to listen on (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--server-port`: Port to listen on (default: 1818)

After starting the server, open your web browser to the displayed URL (e.g., http://localhost:1818).

### Command Interruption and Feedback

<img src="assets/demo-chat-mode-interrupted-1.gif" alt="Command Interrupt Demo" autoplay loop style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">

You can interrupt the agent at any time by pressing `Ctrl-C`. This pauses the agent, allowing you to provide feedback, adjust your instructions, or steer the execution in a new direction. Press `Ctrl-C` again if you want to completely exit the program.


### Shell Command Automation with Cowboy Mode üèá

The `--cowboy-mode` flag enables automated shell command execution without confirmation prompts. This is useful for:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing environments
- Batch processing operations
- Scripted workflows

```bash
ra-aid -m "Update all deprecated API calls" --cowboy-mode
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notes:**
- Cowboy mode skips confirmation prompts for shell commands
- Always use in version-controlled repositories
- Ensure you have a clean working tree before running
- Review changes in git diff before committing

### Model Configuration

RA.Aid supports multiple AI providers and models. The default model is Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet (`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`).

When using the `--use-aider` flag, the programmer tool (aider) automatically selects its model based on your available API keys. It will use Claude models if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set, or fall back to OpenAI models if only OPENAI_API_KEY is available.

Note: The expert tool can be configured to use different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Gemini) using the --expert-provider flag along with the corresponding EXPERT_*API_KEY environment variables. Each provider requires its own API key set through the appropriate environment variable.

#### Environment Variables

RA.Aid supports multiple providers through environment variables:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Required for the default Anthropic provider
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for OpenAI provider
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Required for OpenRouter provider
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: Required for DeepSeek provider
- `OPENAI_API_BASE`: Required for OpenAI-compatible providers along with `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for Gemini provider

Expert Tool Environment Variables:
- `EXPERT_OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for expert tool using OpenAI provider
- `EXPERT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: API key for expert tool using Anthropic provider
- `EXPERT_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: API key for expert tool using OpenRouter provider
- `EXPERT_OPENAI_API_BASE`: Base URL for expert tool using OpenAI-compatible provider
- `EXPERT_GEMINI_API_KEY`: API key for expert tool using Gemini provider
- `EXPERT_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: API key for expert tool using DeepSeek provider

You can set these permanently in your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
# Default provider (Anthropic)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For OpenAI features and expert tool
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For OpenRouter provider
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For OpenAI-compatible providers
export OPENAI_API_BASE=your_api_base_url

# For Gemini provider
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Custom Model Examples

1. **Using Anthropic (Default)**
   ```bash
   # Uses default model (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)
   ra-aid -m "Your task"

   # Or explicitly specify:
   ra-aid -m "Your task" --provider anthropic --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
   ```

2. **Using OpenAI**
   ```bash
   ra-aid -m "Your task" --provider openai --model gpt-4o
   ```

3. **Using OpenRouter**
   ```bash
   ra-aid -m "Your task" --provider openrouter --model mistralai/mistral-large-2411
   ```

4. **Using DeepSeek**
   ```bash
   # Direct DeepSeek provider (requires DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
   ra-aid -m "Your task" --provider deepseek --model deepseek-reasoner
   
   # DeepSeek via OpenRouter
   ra-aid -m "Your task" --provider openrouter --model deepseek/deepseek-r1
   ```

4. **Configuring Expert Provider**

   The expert tool is used by the agent for complex logic and debugging tasks. It can be configured to use different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Gemini, openai-compatible) using the --expert-provider flag along with the corresponding EXPERT_*API_KEY environment variables.

   ```bash
   # Use Anthropic for expert tool
   export EXPERT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   ra-aid -m "Your task" --expert-provider anthropic --expert-model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

   # Use OpenRouter for expert tool
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   ra-aid -m "Your task" --expert-provider openrouter --expert-model mistralai/mistral-large-2411

   # Use DeepSeek for expert tool
   export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
   ra-aid -m "Your task" --expert-provider deepseek --expert-model deepseek-reasoner

   # Use default OpenAI for expert tool

   # Use Gemini for expert tool
   export EXPERT_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ra-aid -m "Your task" --expert-provider gemini --expert-model gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219
   ```

Aider specific Environment Variables you can add:

- `AIDER_FLAGS`: Optional comma-separated list of flags to pass to the underlying aider tool (e.g., "yes-always,dark-mode")

```bash
# Optional: Configure aider behavior
export AIDER_FLAGS="yes-always,dark-mode,no-auto-commits"
```

Note: For `AIDER_FLAGS`, you can specify flags with or without the leading `--`. Multiple flags should be comma-separated, and spaces around flags are automatically handled. For example, both `"yes-always,dark-mode"` and `"--yes-always, --dark-mode"` are valid.

**Important Notes:**
- Performance varies between models. The default Claude 3 Sonnet model currently provides the best and most reliable results.
- Model configuration is done via command line arguments: `--provider` and `--model`
- The `--model` argument is required for all providers except Anthropic (which defaults to `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`)

More information is available in our [Open Models Setup](https://docs.ra-aid.ai/quickstart/open-models) guide.
